# Jungle-Hunter

#### Halil Bahar, Sonja Cao, Christian Donnabauer, Simon Zweim√ºller

### Problem:

Currently the Jungles and Forests in Europe are beeing harmed, just to use the wood for economics. 

### Functionality:

As a user of the app I want to:

+ view tracks on a map
+ view the controlpoints of a track 
+ take and save photos, if I am at a specific Controlpoint
+ export the images as a photobook
+ get achievements if I cleared a track
+ search for specific tracks

### Aim:

The aim of this project is to motivate people to go out and explore those jungles to save them at the same time.
